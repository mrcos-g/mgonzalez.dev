# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project serves as a platform to showcase my work history, personal projects, and other engineering-related endeavors. Built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, it reflects my journey as a software engineer and demonstrates my development skills.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `pnpm install`.
3. First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** - Framework for server-rendered React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design.
- **TypeScript** - Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **Jest** - Used for unit testing to ensure individual components function as intended.
- **CircleCI** - Configured as a continuous integration pipeline that performs linting, testing, and building of the project before deployment to a live environment.

## Acknowledgments

The design of this portfolio was inspired by [Brittany Chiang's website](https://brittanychiang.com/). While the visual layout reflects her work, all code was written independently without referencing her source code. This project was developed to enhance my skills in Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

This project is a work in progress and will be updated as I add new projects, features, and improvements.
